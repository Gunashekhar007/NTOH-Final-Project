# Numerical simulation of 2D long waves induced by seismic seafloor uplift
## Steps for execution of code:
1. First execute the 2004_Indian_ocean.c and Japan_Tohoku.c files.<br>
This produces the simulation wave data<br>
2. Then execute the cells in visualization.ipynb file to create the animation gif files<br>
